## Database migrations

All database migrations live in supabase/migrations. New migrations should be generated using the following supabase command.
```bash
supabase migration new <description>
```
This will create a file in the migrations directory which can then be filled out with the SQL for the migration.

Then to run the new migrations locally, you can use this:
```bash
supabase migration up
```
